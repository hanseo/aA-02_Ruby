#Agile Development is based on Iterative Design

  *co-location: a team is working at the same space, face to face communication.
  *pair-programming: 2 people approaching the same problem 
  *test-driven development: allows rapid iteration and code error-free
  based on iterative refactoring.
  *continous integration: adding newly developed code into the main branch multiple 
  times a day. Avoiding massive merge conflicts.

#Waterfall Development
   Planning & Design aprroval > Coding Start > Testing Start
   This process is  a well-documented, stable path of development
   but it doesn't allow alterations partway into the process.
